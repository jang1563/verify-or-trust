# Archival Release Notes

This repository is prepared for DOI-backed archival releases through GitHub
Releases and Zenodo.

## Current Frozen Release

- Version: `0.1.2`
- GitHub release: `https://github.com/jang1563/verify-or-trust/releases/tag/v0.1.2`
- Canonical revision: Git tag `v0.1.2`
- Companion dataset: `https://huggingface.co/datasets/jang1563/verify-or-trust`

The GitHub tag is the canonical software snapshot. The Hugging Face dataset
hosts benchmark substrate artifacts and the cell subset used by the live
`run_de` tool.

## DOI Update Checklist

After Zenodo mints a DOI for a GitHub release:

1. Add the DOI badge to `README.md`.
2. Add a DOI identifier to `CITATION.cff`.
3. Add the DOI to `artifact_manifest.json` under the `release` object.
4. Add the DOI as a related identifier in `.zenodo.json` if a later archive
   snapshot should explicitly reference the previous DOI.
5. Re-run `python3 scripts/validate_public_release.py`.

Do not add a DOI placeholder before the DOI exists.

## Release Invariants

- The shipped GEARS/Norman substrate remains schema-validated.
- Generated panel JSONL remains strict JSON.
- Arc STATE / Tahoe artifacts remain downloaded from source, not redistributed.
- The manifest points only to public files or public external URLs.
- GitHub Actions must pass on the release commit.
